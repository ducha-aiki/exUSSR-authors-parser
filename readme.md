Here is a very simple parser for slavic surnames in CV-conferences authors.
The main purpose of this tool is to give a short-list of possible exUSSR scientists which has published some paper on computer vision conference
Usage:
./get_CIS_names_candidates_*.sh

Will give you *_unique.txt file with authors names which have given patterns as in slavic_postfixes.txt
In future I may expand it to more clever check and/or checking actual authors affiliation
